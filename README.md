# JIRA Notes Table Generator - Changes Management
Latest version: V 0.7.0 - Changed the Date Range to Created; now searches for issues between a specified range of dates. Previous range period formats still work in addition to this new change.
## Synopsis
This is a webapp that generates a table of 'Change' issues/tasks from JIRA using the JIRA API for quick meeting notes. This webapp also generates a print-friendly page of said meeting notes.

## Motivation
This webapp was created to fulfill the need of quickly creating meeting notes from JIRA and is intended to replace a Excel VBS solution.

## Note
This webapp does not have HTTPS for communication between the webapp and the user. This webapp only uses HTTPS for communicating with JIRA. As such, it is recommended only to use this webapp on a trusted secure network, or on the user's computer.

## Prerequisites
#### This webapp requires:
- npm
- node.js
- jquery (included)

#### Node.js dependencies (included as zip folders):
- body-parser
- ejs
- express
- jquery.tabulator

## Installation
0. Download node.js and npm; go to https://nodejs.org/en/ to download Node.js and https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to download npm. Administrator privileges will be required.
1. Download the webapp and install the prerequisites; extract the three folders named "jquery-ui", and "node_modules" to their respective folder names inside the webapp's root directory.
2. Run the webapp from a command prompt or terminal; open cmd/terminal, cd  to the webapp directory, and start the webapp using "node server.js" without quotes.
3. The webapp should start on localhost port 8081 (localhost:8081). A different address can be specified by editing server.js. The webapp is default tailored for a custom JIRA so custom fields may differ from other JIRAs.
## Date Range
Valid date formats for Created include: 'yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm', 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm', 'yyyy/MM/dd', 'yyyy-MM-dd' or a period format e.g. '-5d', '4w2d'. Leave both blank for no range (not even spaces). Dates are non-inclusive. ie. 2017-01-01 â€“ 2017-01-02 only shows issues created between these two dates and not on the day of 2017-01-02. This is because JIRA uses 12:00 AM by default unless specified otherwise.

### Using the Print function
The Print function takes the user to a page containing a simple html table version of the original table which will allow better printing compatibility. To use this, simply press the print button and then print the page using your browser (i.e. Ctrl+P in Chrome). 
## Print selection
You can now select which issues to print and omit. The default print option is to print, and clicking on the corresponding "P?" column ticks either enables or disables the issue for printing. (Note: if you ever go back to the table page, make sure to refresh the page otherwise the print page might not work properly the next time)

## Troubleshooting Tips
### ETIMEDOUT
This means that the webapp was unable to connect to the JIRA API. Doublecheck the webapp's internet connection to see if there are any proxies or firewalls blocking the connection.
### JSON.parse error
This means that the returned JSON from JIRA was invalid. This usually means that the username or password you entered was incorrect. The least common reason would be an incorrect URL should the JIRA API ever be changed.

## Built With
This webapp uses a slightly bespoke version of Tabulator to create a table. This modified version includes a Print button that calls for /printpage which is a simplified print friendly page of the table. The original Tabulator can be found here: http://olifolkerd.github.io/tabulator/ and currently is used with this project under the MIT License. A copy of the bespoke Tabulator and its original License is included in this Github. All credit for tabulator goes to olifolkerd.
